New Name: Fill er' Up

Instead of cup, dump truck that drives away after full, completing level
Balls are now rocks.

Have a dispenser at the top that moves with the mouse and when clicked, will dispense rocks
You have a bar with how many rocks you have available

Add rock crushers into the level
Spikes destroy rocks after 3 seconds...

Ramps are still there.
